                        House music, or simply house, was created by DJs and producers in Chicago. House was created and
                        pioneered by DJs and producers in Chicago such as Frankie Knuckles, Ron Hardy, Jesse Saunders,
                        Chip E., and others. House music initially expanded to New York City, then internationally to
                        cities such as London, and ultimately became a worldwide phenomenon

                        House is a genre of electronic dance music characterized by a repetitive four-on-the-floor beat
                        and a typical tempo of 115–130 beats per minute.

                        The genre is characterized by repetitive 4/4 rhythms including bass drums, off-beat hi-hats,
                        snare drums, claps, and/or snaps at a tempo of between 120 and 130 beats per minute (bpm). The
                        drumbeats in house music are almost always provided by an electronic drum machine, often a
                        Roland TR-808. Claps, shakers, snare drum, or hi-hat sounds are used to
                        add syncopation.

                    <p class="text-large">
                        House beats often include open hi-hats on the offbeat (in between the kick drums) and claps
                        or snares on every second and fourth beat. Add to that a deep bassline, a
                        synthesizer-generated riff and the occasional soulful or funk-inspired vocal and you've got
                        yourself a quintessential house record.

                            The name "house music" originated from a Chicago club called the Warehouse that was open
                            from 1977-1982. Frankie Knuckles was the resident DJ of the club and he perfected the trend
                            of splicing together different records when he found that the records he had were not long
                            enough to satisfy his audience of dancers.

                            Early house lyrics contained positive, uplifting messages, but spoke especially to African
                            Americans, Latinos, and the gay subculture. The house music dance scene was one of the most
                            integrated and progressive spaces in the
                            1980s. Minority groups were able to dance together in a positive environment.

                            At least three styles of dancing are associated with early house music: jacking, footwork
                            and lofting; these styles include a variety of techniques and sub-styles. One of the primary
                            elements in house dancing is "the jack," or "jacking" — a style created
                            in the early days of Chicago house that left its trace in numerous record titles.

                                Atkins, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three, who fused the
                                futuristic sounds into a signature Detroit sound that was a main influence for the later

                                genre. Their music included elements of Chicago house, although the term "house music"

                                less important role in Detroit than in Chicago, and the term "techno" was established.
