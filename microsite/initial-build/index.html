                        House is a genre of electronic dance music characterized by a repetitive four-on-the-floor beat
                        and a typical tempo of 115–130 beats per minute.

                        The genre is characterized by repetitive 4/4 rhythms including bass drums, off-beat hi-hats,
                        snare drums, claps, and/or snaps at a tempo of between 120 and 130 beats per minute (bpm).

                    <p class="text-large">
                        House beats often include open hi-hats on the offbeat (in between the kick drums) and claps
                        or snares on every second and fourth beat. Add to that a deep bassline, a
                        synthesizer-generated riff and the occasional soulful or funk-inspired vocal and you've got
                        yourself a quintessential house record.

                            The name "house music" originated from a Chicago club called the Warehouse that was open
                            from 1977-1982. Frankie Knuckles was the resident DJ of the club and he perfected the trend
                            of splicing together different records when he found that the records he had were not long
                            enough to satisfy his audience of dancers.

                            After the Warehouse closed in 1983, eventually Larry Levan went on to open a new club. The
                            Powerhouse, later to be called The Power Plant, apparently was renamed, because Music Box

                            Early house lyrics contained positive, uplifting messages, but spoke especially to African
                            Americans, Latinos, and the gay subculture. The house music dance scene was one of the most
                            integrated and progressive spaces in the
                            1980s. Minority groups were able to dance together in a positive environment.

                            At least three styles of dancing are associated with early house music: jacking, footwork
                            and lofting; these styles include a variety of techniques and sub-styles. One of the primary
                            elements in house dancing is "the jack," or "jacking" — a style created
                            in the early days of Chicago house that left its trace in numerous record titles.

                        In Detroit during the early and mid-1980s, a new kind of music began to emerge around Juan
                        Atkins, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson, known as the Belleville Three, who fused the
                        futuristic sounds into a signature Detroit sound that was a main influence for the later techno
                        genre. Their music included elements of Chicago house, although the term "house music" played a
                        less important role in Detroit than in Chicago, and the term "techno" was established.

                        With house music already massive on the 1980s dance scene, it eventually penetrated the UK
                        singles chart. London DJ "Evil" Eddie Richards spun at dance parties as resident at the Clink
                        Street club in London, eventually house music penetrated the UK singles chart. Albums featuring
                        a style or labels came from Ibiza at the time, mixing house music with a more commercial
                        Balearic mix of house was discernable.

                    <p class="text-large">
                        House was also being developed by DJs and record producers in the booming dance club scene in
                        Ibiza. Notably when DJ Alfredo, the father of Balearic house, began his residency at Amnesia in
                        1983. While no house artists or labels came from Ibiza at the time, mixing house music with a
                        more Italo disco influence was discernible.
