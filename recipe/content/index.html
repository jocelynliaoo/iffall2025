        <h2>Good Recipe websites</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://bitesbybianca.com/earl-grey-sugar-cookies/#recipe">Bites by Bianca</a> is the main
                website I had used for the recipe. I think that the website design is very fitting for a baking website.
                It also comes with images and everything within the images are labeled clearly in terms of ingredients.
                There are checkboxes next to each ingredients to keep track of them, and a link to buy ingredients.</li>
            <li><a href="https://theartofbaking.org/earl-grey-shortbread-cookies/">The Art of Baking</a> This one is
                more of a simplistic website which I appreciate because it makes the website more readable. I like that
                theres a button that allows you to jump to the recipe. There are also small paragraphs about how to bake
                shortbread cookies and how to bake with tea leaves which I think provides unique details about the
                recipe.</li>
            <li><a href="https://indecisionandcake.com/2018/12/earl-grey-tea-cookies/">Indecision and Cake</a> This
                website is also very simplistic because it jumps straight to the steps to making the cookies. There are
                also photos that are followed by the instructions. It makes the website very easy to navigate around.

        <h2>Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.notion.com/">Notion</a> is very simple because you have a lot of creative freedom when using Notion. However, if you don't have much creative direction for how to organize your Notion, there are plenty of templates that you can choose from.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> has been around for a long time and has been known to be a widely used social media platform but for a good reason. The icons are all relatively intuitive, the buttons are placed on the screen so that I never really have to go searching for any feature on the app/website.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> is very intuitive as well. It's almost like online shopping but for hotels and places to stay. It's very easy to adjust the filter. The buttons and vibes of the website are very sleek and modern.</li>
        </ul>
