        <ol>
            <li><b>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).
            </b><br>
            My name is Jocelyn, I am a Junior studying Computer Science major </li>

            <li><b>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b><br> 
                I have always been interested in things such as frontend design, and 
                since I was minoring in Human-Computer Interactions, I decided it would
                 be a good idea to take this class</li>

            <li><b>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b><br>
                I learned a little bit about HTML and CSS in middle school and I used 
                Javascript when I took web development last year</li>

            <li><b>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.
            </b><br>
            I hope to learn more about how to design intuitive web page layouts this semester!</li>

            <li><b>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.
            </b><br>Designing for screen can be different from paper because you have to think about
                 the ways that a user would digitally interact with it</li>

            <li><b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b><br>
                I believe that <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> provides a great example of effective design. 
                The concept of the glass feel within their products and websites has revolutionized UI/UX design.
            </li>
            <li><b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.
            </b><br>
                I think that <a href="https://www.notion.com/">Notion</a> Does a good job of effectively helping you plan out your todo tasks and such.
            </li>
            <li><b>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.
            </b><br>
                <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/business/hub/">Pinterest</a> works well because its fairly simple and straight-forward to use.
